## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Basic CSS properties

### What I learned

I learnt about HSL values and how it is different from HEX values and RGB values. In HSL, H stands for 'hue', S stands for 'saturation' and L stands for 'lightness'.
Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.Lightness is also a percentage. 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white. 

*hsl('hue','saturation','lightness')*

Here is a code snippet to see HSL values working

```css
.learnt-new-color-value {
  color: hsl(212, 21%, 66%);;
}
```
### Continued development

I would to like to work more on margins or blank spaces, like different efficient methods to leave blank spaces where needed.
